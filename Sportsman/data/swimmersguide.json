Rarely have I been there when a third to a half of the pool is not taken up by swim team practices. On fall and winter Friday evenings they rope off about half the pool for kayaking practice. Lap swimming is treated more as an after-thought. On most days and time periods, there are six to eight lanes open for lap swimmers, at most, sometimes it's less and, despite the facility's lane-sharing policy, many of our fellow swimmers are reluctant to share a lane. :(  The staff routinely allow one or more of the doors to remain open, even during the winter, when the temperature can drop to the 30s and 40s. Both ", " and ", " are better bets in my opinion.

[January, 2014]", "Staff are not supposed to be opening doors if the temperatures outside are in the 30s and 40s. Perhaps you should talk to management about this. And, if they are concerned about the number of lanes given to private teams, we need patrons to be more vocal at COG (Community Oriented Government) meetings. There are routinely open lanes from 3 PM to closing and we try to balance the needs of all our users. My fear is that websites like this scare swimmers off. We want the public to use their voices.

The water temperature was great for serious workouts! Even better is that the roof allows it to be opened to the outdoors. The locker facilities were great. Helpful and chipper staff (at 6 A.M.). Out-of-towners welcomed!", "Swam here two days during the first week of March 2014. I can confirm this facility is as advertised and reviewed: huge facility, with adjoining YMCA fitness center and 23 lanes in the main pool - no worries for space at 5:30 AM - 7:30 AM, when I was there. Their schedule indicates that they have two or three teams that should be working out at that time, which would take 10 to 14 lanes, depending on the day, but they weren't in evidence the week I was there. The lane schedule is available on the Y website, so check in advance to be sure. I'm not crazy about the stainless gutter sides than extend about a foot or so below the water line and the crack formed where they end at the target, but you get used to it. Both the Ramada Inn (at the North end of the facility) and the Courtyard (at the South end) offer complimentary Y access to guests. The Courtyard has 10 passes on a first come, first served basis (these recycle as guests turn them back in after their work out--the hotel takes back your room key to be sure you do!). What a joy to roll out of bed and have a place like this next door. Note that when they've played water polo the evening before, the pool loses 12 lanes for the following morning until they get the ropes back in. If you are a YMCA member anywhere else, you get a discounted entry and, if you're not at a hotel with a guest pass, they take all walk ins for $10 a visit.

The 50m pool is not usually open for lap swim and the admission price for visitors is steep. I believe the pool has been used as a training facility for Olympic swimmers.", "The 50m pool is often configured for multiple activities taking place simultaneously. Asphalt Green is a venue that attracts serious swimmers. It's legendary for its competitive swimming instruction and Masters Swim Team, and regularly hosts swim meets for NYC's elite private schools. Lia Neal, 2012 Olympic Bronze Medalist in the Women's 4 x 100m freestyle relay, trained at AG and is now on her way to Stanford University on a full scholarship. [May, 2013]", "For serious swimmers, Asphalt Green is one of the most frustrating places to swim. The facility is very nice but the members' lanes are often a complete disaster. The guards do not enforce lane etiquette or common rules for lane-sharing safety. There is an entitled group of members who, no matter how poorly and slowly they swim, will not move from whichever lane they've decided to jump into, even if multiple people are trying to work-out in the same lane cooperatively. This is not the complaint of a single bad experience but from someone who has swum there for years, on different days and at different times. This place is a nightmare for serious lap swimmers and, for the price, it's the worst deal in the city. Be warned! [September, 2013]", "Probably the nicest pool in Manhattan, but that is a pretty low bar.  I'm from LA and there are a million pools out there nicer than this (Santa Monica City College etc.).  The main problem with the pool is that during general lap swimming people pay no attention to the FAST, MEDIUM, SLOW signs and just get in wherever they want.  Unfortunately, the lifeguards and staff do nothing to insure that faster people are in the fast lane, etc.  The result is chaos.  If you are a good swimmer, swimming during regular lap swim hours on the weekend is a nightmare.  I swam there yesterday (Saturday) and there were two guys in the fast lane who were swimming  glacially slow breaststroke and making zero effort to not get in my way.  Like I said, nightmare.", "\r\nYou might as well save money and go to the Y.", "[March, 2014]"], "tel": "(212) 369-8890", "name": "Asphalt Green Aquacenter", "admission": "$35.00, available only during designated family/adult recreation periods.
